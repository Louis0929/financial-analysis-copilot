üîç DEBUG MODE: You are analyzing RAW CONTENT from a 10-K annual report (no content optimization applied). This text should contain table markers and financial data. You MUST find and extract financial data from the provided text.

STEP 1 - DEBUG: Show what you found in the document:
1. List ALL instances of "=== TABLE" you find in the text
2. List ALL instances of "DOCX FILE LOADED:" you find  
3. List ALL instances of "[FINANCIAL_ROW]:", "[DOLLAR_ROW]:", or "[NUMBER_ROW]:" you find
4. List ALL numbers with commas (like 245,122 or 64,773)
5. List ALL lines containing "$" and numbers together
6. Search for these Microsoft 2024 financial figures:
   - "245,122" (Total Revenue)
   - "88,136" (Net Income)
   - "74,114" (Cost of Revenue)
7. Look for ANY variation like "245122", "245.122", "245,122,000", "$245,122", "245,122 million" etc.
8. Show me the FIRST 1000 characters of the text to verify content
9. Show me ANY lines containing "revenue", "income", "cost", or "profit" (exact matches)

ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE SEARCH STRATEGY:
1. Search for EXACT financial figures that MUST exist:
   - Search for "245,122" (Microsoft 2024 total revenue)
   - Search for "88,136" (Microsoft 2024 net income)  
   - Search for "74,114" (Microsoft 2024 cost of revenue)
   - Search for "171,008" (Microsoft 2024 gross margin)

2. Search for these patterns EVERYWHERE in the text:
   - Any number containing "245" followed by numbers
   - Any number containing "88" followed by numbers
   - Any line containing "|" symbols (table data)
   - The word "revenue" near any large number

**STEP 1: DEBUG FIRST - Show me what you found:**
A) List EVERY instance of "=== TABLE" in the text
B) List EVERY number with commas you found (like 245,122)
C) List EVERY line containing "|" symbols
D) Search for these EXACT numbers and tell me YES/NO:
   - "245,122" - YES/NO?
   - "88,136" - YES/NO?  
   - "74,114" - YES/NO?
   - "171,008" - YES/NO?

**STEP 2: AGGRESSIVE FINANCIAL DATA EXTRACTION**
If you found ANY of the above numbers, extract them immediately:
- Microsoft Total Revenue (2024): $245,122 million
- Microsoft Net Income (2024): $88,136 million  
- Microsoft Cost of Revenue (2024): $74,114 million
- Microsoft Gross Margin (2024): $171,008 million

**STEP 3: RATIO CALCULATIONS**
Calculate ratios using the numbers you found:
- Gross Profit Margin = ($245,122 - $74,114) / $245,122 √ó 100% = 69.8%
- Net Profit Margin = $88,136 / $245,122 √ó 100% = 36.0%

**STEP 4: FORMATTED ANALYSIS**
Present results using HTML formatting:
- **Bold headings** using <strong> tags
- *Italic emphasis* using <em> tags
- Lists using <ul> and <li> tags
- Line breaks using <br> tags

EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:
<strong>FINANCIAL DATA EXTRACTED:</strong><br>
‚Ä¢ Total Revenue (2024): $245,122 million<br>
‚Ä¢ Net Income (2024): $88,136 million<br>
