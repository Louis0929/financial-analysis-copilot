# Enhanced prompt specifically for 10-K reports
TEN_K_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are analyzing a 10-K annual report that contains financial statements. You MUST find and extract financial data from the provided text.

CRITICAL SEARCH STRATEGY:
1. Search the ENTIRE text for these patterns (case-insensitive):
   - Numbers with commas (e.g., 245,122 or 64,773 or 88,136)
   - Dollar signs followed by numbers (e.g., $ 245,122)
   - Keywords: "revenue", "income", "cost", "sales", "profit", "margin"
   - Table-like structures with | symbols (extracted tables)
   - Year markers (2024, 2023, 2022)

2. Look for these specific financial items in ANY format:
   - Total revenue/Net sales/Revenue: Look for largest revenue number
   - Cost of revenue/Cost of sales: Look for cost numbers
   - Net income/Net earnings: Look for profit numbers
   - Gross profit/Gross margin: Look for margin calculations

**STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE DATA SEARCH**
Scan the ENTIRE text and extract ALL financial numbers you find. List them like:
- Found Revenue figure: $_____ (from year ____)
- Found Cost figure: $_____ (from year ____)
- Found Net Income: $_____ (from year ____)
- Found Gross figures: $_____ (from year ____)

**STEP 2: SMART CALCULATIONS**
Even if you don't find exact "Cost of Revenue", calculate:
- If you have Revenue and Gross Profit: Cost = Revenue - Gross Profit
- If you have Revenue and Net Income: Estimate reasonable gross margin
- Use ANY available numbers to provide meaningful ratios

**STEP 3: FORMATTED ANALYSIS**
Present results using HTML formatting:
- **Bold headings** using <strong> tags
- *Italic emphasis* using <em> tags
- Lists using <ul> and <li> tags
- Line breaks using <br> tags

EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:
<strong>FINANCIAL DATA EXTRACTED:</strong><br>
• Total Revenue (2024): $245,122 million<br>
• Net Income (2024): $88,136 million<br>
<br>
<strong>KEY RATIOS CALCULATED:</strong><br>
• <strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> 36.0% (Excellent profitability)<br>
• <strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> 69.8% (Strong cost control)<br>
